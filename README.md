To allow GitHub Actions to send emails from your Gmail account, you must generate an App Password.

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords  
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if you havenâ€™t already  
3. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" or "GitHub" as the device  
4. Click **Generate** and copy the 16-character App Password  
5. Note: Use this App Password in place of your actual Gmail password

### 2. Set Repository Secrets on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository â†’ `Settings` â†’ `Secrets and variables` â†’ `Actions` â†’ `New repository secret`.

Add the following:

| Secret Name | Value                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `EMAIL`     | Your Gmail address            |
| `PASSWORD`  | The 16-character App Password |

### 3. Verify Files in Repository

Ensure the following files are present:

#### âœ… `app.py`

Contains the logic for sending the email using `smtplib`.

#### âœ… `.github/workflows/send_email.yml`

Contains the GitHub Actions workflow that runs `app.py` every Monday.

## ðŸ“… How It Works

- **Trigger**: The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered every Monday at 3:00 AM UTC (8:30 AM IST) using a cron schedule.
- **Job**: It sets up Python, injects the email credentials using secrets, and runs `app.py`.
- **Result**: An email is sent to the configured recipients.
